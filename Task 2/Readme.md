# Project Readme

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing customer data from trial stores and their corresponding control stores. The goal is to understand the impact of certain interventions on customer numbers by comparing trial stores with scaled control stores.

## Store 77 Analysis

For Store 77, the analysis involved scaling the control store data to match the trial store's pre-trial period. The comparison was visualized through plots showing the number of customers over time, including confidence intervals for the control store.

### Key Results for Store 77

- **Average Customer Uplift**: During the trial period, Store 77 experienced an average customer uplift of approximately `avg_customer_percentage_diff_77`%.
- **Total Customer Difference**: The total customer difference during the trial period was `total_customer_diff_77` customers, which is a `total_customer_percentage_diff_77`% difference compared to the scaled control store.

## Store 86 Analysis

The analysis for Store 86 follows a similar methodology as Store 77, focusing on sales data. The control store for Store 86 was selected based on the best match for sales metrics.

### Key Results for Store 86

- **Average Sales Uplift**: The average sales uplift during the trial period for Store 86 will be calculated similarly to Store 77.
- **Total Sales Difference**: The total sales difference during the trial period will be determined to assess the impact of the intervention.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the effectiveness of interventions at trial stores by comparing them with appropriately scaled control stores. The results highlight the changes in customer numbers and sales, offering valuable information for strategic decision-making.
