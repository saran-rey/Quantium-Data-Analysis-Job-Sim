# Project Readme

### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer data from trial stores and their corresponding control stores. The goal is to understand the impact of certain interventions on customer numbers by comparing trial stores with scaled control stores.

To install the required packages, run this in the terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Findings

### Exceptional March Results:

Store 77: Achieved 42.1% sales increase above projected performance in March
Store 86: Generated 27.4% sales lift above expected levels in March
Store 88: Delivered 20.1% sales growth above baseline projections in March

### Customer Engagement During Peak Month:

Store 77: Customer visits increased 33.3% above expected levels in March
Store 86: Customer traffic grew 19.5% beyond projected numbers in March
Store 88: Customer engagement rose 17.3% above anticipated visits in March

### Why March Dominated Performance:

Promotional activities gained momentum after initial February launch
Customer awareness and engagement reached optimal levels
Marketing messages resonated most effectively during this period

## Conclusion
The results for trial stores 77 and 88 during the trial period show a significant difference in at least two of the
three trial months but this is not the case for trial store 86. We can check with the client if the implementation
of the trial was different in trial store 86 but overall, the trial shows a significant increase in sales. Now that
we have finished our analysis, we can prepare our presentation to the Category Manager
